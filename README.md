# haveibeenpwned

Write a Python program that reads the file input.txt and uses the API from
https://haveibeenpwned.com to see whether or not each password from the file
has been compromised.

The program should print each password and whether or not it's safe to use.

Note: You may want to try the program separately with one good password, then one bad one.

## The first two lines of output should look something like this ##
HelloWorld -> pwnded
BHSD(*2)fa#23df -> safe
